## Task 2: Build a Serverless ML system for the Wine Quality Dataset

We built a pipeline for the [Wine Quality Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajyellow46/wine-quality) in the same manner as shown above. After analysing the dataset properties, a feature group for model training was created and a reasonably performing model for the prediction of the classes of wine quality was implemented. Finally, we created an interactive UI for queryable wine quality prediction and a dashboard UI showing the synthetic wine data generated by a realistic wine simulation function and the recent prediction history.
